This code appears to have two parts:

A frequency analysis of words in an input text file, and
A user input loop that searches for a given string in the same text file.
The first part of the code reads in an input text file, removes certain common words, and uses regular expressions to find all words with between 3 and 15 lowercase letters. The code then counts the frequency of each word and prints out each word and its frequency.

The second part of the code enters into a loop that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a string to search for in the input text file. If the user enters "Stop" or an empty string, the loop will exit. Otherwise, the code will search for the given string in the input text file and count how many times it appears. The count is then printed to the console.
